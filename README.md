# Java Sorting Algorithms

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of three sorting algorithms: QuickSort, MergeSort, and BubbleSort. Each algorithm is implemented as a static method in the `SortingAlgorithms` class.

## Features
- QuickSort: An efficient, divide-and-conquer algorithm.
- MergeSort: A stable sorting algorithm that uses merging.
- BubbleSort: A simple, comparison-based algorithm.
